Emotion Identifying and Journaling App

While I was in college, I had a counselor tell me I was horrible at identifying my emotions properly. Instead of describing feelings as "Optimistic", "Disappointed", "Proud", "Infuriated", etc. - I would describe them in their most basic forms of "Happy", "Sad", "Angry", etc.. I found myself referencing an "Emotion Wheel" to practice emotion identification, but I wanted a more interactive way of doing so. I also wanted a journaling aspect of it so I could report back to my therapist about different events that happened between sessions. 

Mindfl is just the solution I've been wanting. There was no free app that would allow for emotion identification or journaling in quite the way I wanted.
